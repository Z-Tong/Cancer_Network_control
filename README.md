This package includes Matlab scripts and several datasets for demo of cancer_network_control approaches:
(a)	main_cancer_network_control.m is a Matlab function for the routine of experimental analysis.main_cancer_network_control.m is the   
    main script to call function of cancer_network_control.m.
(b)  cancer_network_control.m is the main script to call cancer_network_control. The input datasets of cancer_network_control.minclude:
    (1) expression_tumor_fileName.txt: the gene tumor expression data.
    (2) expression_normal_fileName.txt: the gene normal expression data.
        Note that the samples in expression_tumor_fileName.txt  and expression_normal_fileName.txt  should be paired.
    (3) index: denotes we use which network construction method 
         %if index=1,we use SSN [1].
         %if index=2,we use paired SSN [2].
         %if index=3,we use LIONESS [3].

The output datasets include:
The sample-specific driver profiles (matrix) by using MMS[4],MDS[5],DFVS[6],NCUA[2]; For “MMS or MDS,DFVS,NCUA”, the column is the samples and the rows is the genes. The value “1” denoted that the gene is driver genes; 

(c) As a demo, users can directly run main_Benchmark_control.m in Matlab. We choose a quick test example whcih contains normal and tumor sample data of 5 patients obtained from BRCA in TCGA. The users can directly run our code to find personalized driver genes in other cancer data sets. This package has been tested in different computer environments as: Window 7 or above; Matlab 2014 or above.
(d) When users analyzed yourself new data, please:
   (1) Prepare input datasets as introduced in (b).
   (2) Clear the previous results.
   (3) Run main_cancer_network_control.m.
   (4) Suggest that the users add all fille in our folders to your folder.
